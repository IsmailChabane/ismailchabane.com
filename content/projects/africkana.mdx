## Project Overview

Africkana Radio is a progressive web application designed to showcase and stream African music to a global audience. The platform combines modern web technologies with a deep appreciation for African musical heritage.
## Key Features

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Full offline capabilities allowing users to enjoy music even without internet connection
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard providing insights into user engagement and music preferences
- **Content Management**: Robust admin panel for managing music library, user accounts, and platform analytics
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
## Technical Implementation
The application leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance, with Firebase providing real-time database capabilities and user authentication. The PWA features are implemented using modern web APIs to ensure reliable offline functionality.
## Challenges & Solutions
One of the main challenges was implementing efficient music streaming while maintaining offline capabilities. This was solved by implementing a smart caching strategy that preloads popular tracks and allows users to download their favorite music for offline listening.
## Impact
The platform has successfully connected African artists with a global audience, providing a dedicated space for African music discovery and streaming.
